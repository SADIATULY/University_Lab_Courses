Removing one feature causes Information Loss. Without the \"Water Intake\" data, the model might find two individuals who have the same activity and sleep hours but different water intake levels. Since the model can no longer see the difference in water intake, it might struggle to distinguish why one is \"Fit\" and the other is \"Unfit,\" leading to higher errors and poor classification."
